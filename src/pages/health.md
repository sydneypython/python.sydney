# Health and Wellness Policy (incl. COVID)

At Sydney Python, we are committed to creating an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone, including those who may be at higher risk or prefer to take extra precautions.

To support the health and safety of our community:

* **Mask-friendly space**: We welcome and encourage anyone who wants or needs to wear a mask. Please be respectful of others’ choices.


* **Stay home if unwell**: If you feel unwell, have symptoms that might be infectious, or if you are awaiting test results, please do not attend. This includes COVID-19 or other illnesses.

If you’ve RSVP’d to a meetup/event that is ‘sold out’ and can no longer attend for health reasons, we also appreciate you cancelling your RSVP or letting the organisers know so someone else can attend.

By following these guidelines, we can make our community more accessible and safer for everyone. Thank you for your consideration and care!
