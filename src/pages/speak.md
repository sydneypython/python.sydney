# Speak at Sydney Python

Speaking at a meetup is a great way to be involved in the local Python community. We welcome speakers of all experiences, including first time presentors.

We're a friendly and welcoming community, and we're actively looking for new speakers and ideas.

Talks could include:

* Lightning talks (5 minutes!)
* Short talks
* Technical talks
* Skills talks
* Tools talks
* Things youâ€™ve built or learnt, talks!

And we want to repeat: first time speakers are **VERY** welcome!
