We're getting the gang back together again!

​Welcome to the first new Sydney Python Meetup of 2025, where we're rebooting a monthly gathering all about Python 🧑‍💻.

​To kick things off we're having an informal social drinks at a venue near Wynyard station (specific location is shared to everyone registered in Luma). Note this is not a sponsored event, so its B(uy)YO for the first one.

​We'll also announce the dates, location and speakers for our May meetup on the night!

​So what are you waiting for!? RSVP today and we'll see you **Thursday 17 April** for a sneaky after work catch up!

### Speak or sponsor a future meetup
​We're always looking for speakers and sponsors for future meetups!
